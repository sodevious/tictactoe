We really enjoyed speaking with you and are thrilled about your interest in becoming a developer at the Flatiron School.

As a next step, we'd like to invite you to the next stage of our interview process. We've created a challenge for you to chew on, so we can get a better idea of how you think:

Your mission is to make a simple Tic-Tac-Toe game with code. A few guidelines-

1) You can use whatever language you'd like (we suggest Ruby or Javascript).
2) Use whatever coding environment you'd like (jsfiddle.net is a good place to start for a browser-based Javascript editor). You can even use TextEdit and just write code. Your choice.
3) Use as many online resources as you like, but the challenge is meant to be completed alone, so please don't take any outside help.
4) On the front-end, there is no need to make it pretty. We are looking to see how you approach solving it and breaking it down.

The point of this exercise is NOT to see if you can get it right, or find the answer on the internet. It's to understand as much as possible and think through the steps of solving the problem. You're MUCH better off submitting code that doesn't work that you really thought through and understand, than code that you find online that just works.

Just like last time, select a slot in our calendar (only 20 minutes this time) so we can review your code together.
